    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Crumble 200 to 250 grams paneer with your fingers and keep aside. I have used homemade paneer.</li>
        <li>Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a frying pan or kadai (wok) or a sauté pan or frying pan. You can even use ghee or butter, instead of oil.</li>
        <li>Add ½ teaspoon cumin seeds and let them crackle on low to medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Then, add ½ cup finely chopped onions.</li>
        <li>Sauté the onions on medium-low heat till translucent and soft.</li>
        <li>Next, add 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste and 1 or 2 chopped green chilies (about ½ to 1 teaspoon, chopped).</li>
        <li>Mix very well and sauté for some seconds till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup tightly packed finely chopped tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Mix the tomatoes and begin to sauté on medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Sauté the tomatoes till completely soft. You can also add a pinch of salt, so that the tomatoes cook faster.</li>
        <li>Now add all the ground spice powders:
            <ul>
                <li>¼ teaspoon turmeric powder (ground turmeric)</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon red chilli powder (or ¼ to ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper)</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon coriander powder (ground coriander)</li>
                <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Mix very well and sauté for 5 to 6 seconds on low to medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Add the crumbled paneer and salt as per taste.</li>
        <li>Mix thoroughly and cook for 1 minute. Don’t cook the paneer for a long time, as it hardens and looses its softness.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and add 3 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves. Mix very well.</li>
        <li>Serve Paneer Bhurji hot with roti, chapati, phulka, paratha, pav (dinner rolls) or bread, with a side of thinly sliced onions and lemon wedges.</li>
